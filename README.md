# -Movie-Watch-Pattern-Clustering---202401100300024
This project analyzes movie-watching behavior by clustering users based on three key factors: time of watching, genre preference, and rating behavior. Using Python, we process a sample dataset that includes timestamps, genres, and user ratings. We extract features like the hour of the day and day of the week, convert genres into numeric values, and apply KMeans clustering to identify groups of users with similar viewing patterns.

The results are visualized using a scatter plot, showing how different clusters behave in terms of watch time and rating. This type of analysis helps streaming platforms better understand user habits, improve recommendation systems, and create more personalized viewing experiences.
